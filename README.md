# Clustering Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains solutions to both theoretical and practical questions related to clustering algorithms in machine learning. The assignment covers key concepts such as K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN, and evaluation metrics like Silhouette Score and Inertia. The practical questions involve implementing these algorithms on various datasets, including synthetic data and real-world datasets like Iris, Wine, and Breast Cancer.
